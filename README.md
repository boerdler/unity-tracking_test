# unity-tracking_test
Test scenes for tracking systems to determine spatial drift

After downloading and unzipping the Assets, you still need to add:

*Intel RealSense SDK v2.42.0 + Unity Plugin, if you want to use the T265 scene
*Zed SDK 3.4.1 + Nvidia Cuda 11.1 + Unity Plugin, if you want to use the Zed Mini scene
